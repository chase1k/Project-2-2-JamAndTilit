# Project-2-2-JamAndTilit

This is the second part of a project that I have completed for my computer science class.
Not all the code was by me, some of the code was made by the instructor adding some functionality that didn't concern what we were learning and the base template for what I coded.

This part of the project culminated most of the things we learned for Java including but not limited to Bracktracking, GUIs, Model-View-Controller, Exceptions, IO and more

This second part was also done with a partner, I was partnered with my friend Owen and the work was split between us. He completed the Jam part and I completed the Tilt. We also used his general solver from part one of the project but both of ours work so it didnt matter except I had to code differently to work with his solver. We were both pushing to the same repository and learned how to work with a team using GitHub 

This lab had alot of test files so it transferred not so cleanly
During the time to complete this project we also covered Backtracking, Threads, Networking, Dijkstra's Shortest Path, and Heaps in class
